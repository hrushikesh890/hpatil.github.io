excerpt: 'Quantum computers in the NISQ era are prone to noise. A range of quantum error mitigation techniques has been proposed to address this issue. Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) stands out as a promising one. ZNE involves increasing the noise levels in a circuit and then using extrapolation to infer the zero noise case from the noisy results obtained. This paper presents a novel ZNE approach that does not require circuit folding or noise scaling to mitigate depolarizing and/or decoherence noise. To mitigate depolarizing noise, we propose leveraging the extreme/infinite noisy case, which allows us to avoid circuit folding. Specifically, the circuit output with extreme noise becomes the maximally mixed state. We show that using circuit-reliability metrics, simple linear extrapolation can effectively mitigate depolarizing noise.'
