title: "Variational quantum linear solver with a dynamic ansatz"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/davqls
excerpt: 'Variational quantum algorithms have found success in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era owing to their hybrid quantum-classical approach which mitigate the problems of noise in quantum computers. In our paper, we introduce the dynamic ansatz in the variational quantum linear solver for a system of linear algebraic equations. In this improved algorithm, the number of layers in the hardware efficient ansatz circuit is evolved, starting from a small and gradually increasing until convergence of the solution is reached. We demonstrate the algorithm advantage in comparison to the standard static ansatz by utilizing fewer quantum resources and with a smaller quantum depth on average in the presence and absence of quantum noise and in cases when the number of qubits or condition number of the system matrices are increased.'
